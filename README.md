Installation
------------
It is recommended to install MyHDL (and your project's other dependencies) in
a virtualenv.

Installing the latest stable release:

```
pip install myhdl
```
Unfortunately the version on PyPI is quite behind the current development status, so you are better off installing the *stable* master branch directly from this GitHub repository:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/myhdl/myhdl.git@master
```

To install a local clone of the repository:

```
pip install -e path/to/dir
```

To install a specific commit hash, tag or branch from git:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/myhdl/myhdl@f696b8
```


You can test the proper installation as follows:

```
cd myhdl/test/core
py.test
```

To install co-simulation support:

Go to the directory ``cosimulation/<platform>`` for your target platform
and following the instructions in the ``README.txt`` file.
